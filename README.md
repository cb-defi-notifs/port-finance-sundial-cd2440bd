# ‚è∞ Sundial

Sundial is a yield tokenizer program on Solana. It tokenizes a user's position into two parts:
- principle (maps one-to-one to the underlying token)
- yield (variable part which depends on the yield of the underlying protocols)

At maturity 1 principle tokens allow users to exchange for 1 underlying tokens. 1 yield tokens allow users to redeem the interest earned during the loan period.
